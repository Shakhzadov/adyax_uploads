#About my job:

Pluses:
+ Page looks quite simple for understanding what we have to do on it;
+ All types of files can be uploaded;
+ Page reloads automatically after uploading new files or deleting existing;
+ You can click on file and open it (to understand what is inside, before download);
+ Upload, Download and Deletion work;

Minuses:
- Page need more CSS or Bootstrap use on it;
- File deletion can be done in a better way (by clicking the button);
- File downloads are hardcoded (need to be fixed for sure);
- It would be better to put filename, deletion and download in one table;
- Parts of code in index.php need to be composed in a different files for better readability;

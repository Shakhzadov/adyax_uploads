#About my job: 
- Right now I can say, that page looks quite simple, which is a plus for understanding what we have to do on it. But in the same way it looks a bit boring, so maybe I need to use more CSS or even JS. 
- All types of files can be uploaded. In 'real life' I think we have to choose some type, like image or text.
- I don't like the way I need to go through, to see the list of files after upload new file. I think the best way is to reload the page automatically, if the upload was successfull.
- Also I have to add functionality (download and delete files) and show the size of each file. If it is possible I will do this in 2 days.
